# Image-Encryption-by-ElGamal-Cryptosystem
Image Encryption by ElGamal Cryptosystem - a cryptographically secure transfer protocol

The project consists of the following 6 files:

       • ImageEncryptionGui.m
       • ImageEncryptionGui.fig 
       • keyGen.m
       • imageProcess.m
       • imageProcessKey.m
       • imageProcessDec.m

The code to run our program is contained in the .m files while the .fig file represents the GUI for taking the images to be encrypted and storing the decrypted ones.
To run
        click on run in the ImageEncryptionGui.m file
        The gui opens up, and click on the button for selecting the message.
        Further, click on the button to display the key, mask and received message.
     
Since the received and input images are almost exactly the same, therefore our algorithm yields the correct result.
